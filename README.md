# first class assignment

In this assignment our job was to find and edit any broken or error worthy code in VScode. At first it was a bit of a struggle but after some help and a lo of googling I 
hope I managed to get as close to the rquirement as possible. My only main concern is that the CSS sheet isnt showing when i click on the link. With that out of the way, I had 
some hard time trying to even start l;ooking for any bad code, I'm very new to this so I didn't really see it right away.
I did my best with refactoring all the links in CSS and make the stylesheet as neat as possible.
For the html side, I renamed tags and added additional tags to fit the requirements to make the page work.
